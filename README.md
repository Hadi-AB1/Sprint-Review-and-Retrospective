# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

1- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- To understand user needs, begin with system assessment. It is possible to do this by soliciting input from existing users and covering the changes in the code. This system's particular inputs and outputs ought to be specified. A user narrative is an excellent technique to describe user requirements. It is a tool that is commonly used in Agile development. It can aid in comprehending the end-users point of view. It also aids in comprehending what the consumer desires and creating a straightforward demand specification for it.

2- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- Several project management methodologies may be employed during program development. One such tactic is the waterfall methodology. It aids in predicting requirements and implementing particular strategies. Iterative, prototype, agile, and progressive methodologies are also used. Crystal, Scrum, Extreme Programming, and other well-known agile methodologies should be incorporated. These methodologies and procedures provide different approaches to testing, planning, and integration.

3- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

- In the programming and design phases, a good team member adheres to the team standards and project approaches. It is critical for the team to retain a sense of accomplishment. All factors of project development ought to be taken into account. One ought to respond in a kind manner and accept responsibility for one's actions.
